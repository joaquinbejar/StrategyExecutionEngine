Adverse Selection
According to "Empirical Market Microstructure" by Joel Hasbrouck, adverse
selection strategies involve monitoring and adjusting order executions to avoid
being exploited by traders with superior information. This involves being aware
of the information asymmetry in the market and making execution decisions
that mitigate the risk of trading against better-informed participants.

Example: A trader might adjust their execution strategy when they detect
unusual trading patterns that suggest informed trading, thus reducing the
potential losses from adverse selection.

Reference for Further Reading:
"Empirical Market Microstructure" by Joel Hasbrouck: This book covers
various aspects of adverse selection and its impact on trading strategies.
(Chapter 4 provides insights into adverse selection and methods to manage it).
